# autograding-troubles-js

After accepting a GitHub Classroom assignment, you should get a link to your own repo with the initial code and auto-grading setup.

If everything worked as it should you will see:
- A directory called `.github`:
    - <img src="./github_dir.png" width="200">
- 3 commits with the  following messages:
    - ![commits](./autograding_commits.png)
- A failing workflow on a list under the `Actions` tab in your repo:
     - ![actions tab](./actions.png)


### Problem

If anything from the above list is not true for your repo, you won't be able to get auto-grading for your assignment.


### Solution

To solve the described problem, just copy the `.github` directory from this repo into yours.
